# title: CVE checks
# description: >-
#   This package is responsible for verifying a CVE scan was performed during
#   the build pipeline, and that the image under test does not contain CVEs
#   of certain security levels.
#
#
#   The behaviour of the rules in this package is influenced by rule data.
#   Firstly the rules can be configured to emit violations or warnings based on
#   the availability of the vulnerability fix: patched -- if there is a
#   remediation available, e.g. new version with a fix, or unpatched -- if there
#   is, currently, no remidiation available. Secondly per severity: critical,
#   high, medium, low or unknown choice can be made of the rule outcome: failure
#   or warning. And lastly, per severity, choice can be made of how many leeway
#   days are allowed before a vulnerability causing a failure will be reported
#   as a warning instead.
#
#
#   In the following example if rule data configuration, failures will be
#   reported for critical and high patched vulnerabilities, for critical
#   unpatched vulnerabilities only, warnings will be reported for medium and low
#   patched, and for high and medium unpatched vulnerabilities. For critical and
#   high patched vulnerabilities a leeway of 10 days is allowed.
