[cols="2,6"]

|*Package Name*
|*Description*

| xref:packages/attestation_type_package.adoc[attestation_type]
a| Sanity checks related to the format of the image build's attestation.

| xref:packages/base_image_registries_package.adoc[base_image_registries]
a| This package is responsible for verifying the base (parent) images reported in the SLSA Provenace or the SBOM are allowed.

| xref:packages/buildah_build_task_package.adoc[buildah_build_task]
a| This package is responsible for verifying the buildah build task

| xref:packages/cve_package.adoc[cve]
a| This package is responsible for verifying a CVE scan was performed during the build pipeline, and that the image under test does not contain CVEs of certain security levels.

| xref:packages/external_parameters_package.adoc[external_parameters]
a| Verify the attribute .predicate.buildDefinition.externalParameters of a SLSA Provenance v1.0 matches the expectation.

| xref:packages/github_certificate_package.adoc[github_certificate]
a| Verify attributes on the certificate involved in the image signature when using slsa-github-generator on GitHub Actions with Sigstore Fulcio

| xref:packages/hermetic_build_task_package.adoc[hermetic_build_task]
a| This package verifies the build task in the attestation was invoked with the expected parameters to perform a hermetic build.

| xref:packages/labels_package.adoc[labels]
a| Check if the image has the expected labels set. The rules in this package distinguish file-based catalog (FBC) images from all other images. When checking an FBC image, a policy rule may use a different set of rule data. An FBC image is detected by the presence of the operators.operatorframework.io.index.configs.v1 label.

| xref:packages/olm_package.adoc[olm]
a| Checks for Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) bundles.

| xref:packages/provenance_materials_package.adoc[provenance_materials]
a| This package provides rules for verifying the contents of the materials section of the SLSA Provenance attestation.

| xref:packages/quay_expiration_package.adoc[quay_expiration]
a| Policies to prevent releasing an image to quay that has a quay expiration date. In Konflux images with an expiration date are produced by "on-pr" build pipelines, i.e. pre-merge CI builds, so this is intended to prevent accidentally releasing a CI build.

| xref:packages/rhtap_multi_ci_package.adoc[rhtap_multi_ci]
a| Checks for images built using an RHTAP build pipeline in either Jenkins, GitLab or GitHub. RHTAP pipelines are defined under https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-sample-templates/tree/main/skeleton/ci

| xref:packages/rpm_packages_package.adoc[rpm_packages]
a| Rules used to verify different properties of specific RPM packages found in the SBOM of the image being validated.

| xref:packages/rpm_pipeline_package.adoc[rpm_pipeline]
a| This package provides rules for verifying the RPMs are built in an approved pipeline

| xref:packages/rpm_repos_package.adoc[rpm_repos]
a| This package defines rules to confirm that all RPM packages listed in SBOMs specify a known and permitted repository id.

| xref:packages/rpm_signature_package.adoc[rpm_signature]
a| This package provides rules for verifying the signatures of RPMs identified in the the SLSA Provenance attestation.

| xref:packages/sbom_package.adoc[sbom]
a| Checks general properties of the SBOMs associated with the image being validated. More specific rules for SPDX and CycloneDX SBOMs are in separate packages.

| xref:packages/sbom_cyclonedx_package.adoc[sbom_cyclonedx]
a| Checks different properties of the CycloneDX SBOMs associated with the image being validated.

| xref:packages/slsa_build_build_service_package.adoc[slsa_build_build_service]
a| The SLSA requirement states the following:
"All build steps ran using some build service, not on a developer’s workstation."
This package verifies the requirement by asserting the image was built by Tekton Pipelines.

| xref:packages/slsa_build_scripted_build_package.adoc[slsa_build_scripted_build]
a| The SLSA requirement states the following:
"All build steps were fully defined in some sort of “build script”. The only manual command, if any, was to invoke the build script."
This package verifies the requirement by asserting the image was built by Tekton Pipelines.

| xref:packages/slsa_provenance_available_package.adoc[slsa_provenance_available]
a| The SLSA Provenance Available requirement states the following:
"The provenance is available to the consumer in a format that the consumer accepts. The format SHOULD be in-toto SLSA Provenance, but another format MAY be used if both producer and consumer agree and it meets all the other requirements."
This package only accepts the in-toto SLSA Provenance format.

| xref:packages/slsa_source_version_controlled_package.adoc[slsa_source_version_controlled]
a| This package verifies the requirement by asserting the image was built from a git repository.

| xref:packages/slsa_source_correlated_package.adoc[slsa_source_correlated]
a| This package correlates the provided source code reference with the source code referenced in the attestation.

| xref:packages/sbom_spdx_package.adoc[sbom_spdx]
a| Checks different properties of the CycloneDX SBOMs associated with the image being validated.

| xref:packages/schedule_package.adoc[schedule]
a| Rules that verify the current date conform to a given schedule.

| xref:packages/source_image_package.adoc[source_image]
a| This package is reponsible for verifying the source container image associated with the image being validated.

| xref:packages/attestation_task_bundle_package.adoc[attestation_task_bundle]
a| To be able to reproduce and audit builds accurately it's important to know exactly what happened during the build. To do this Conforma requires that all tasks are defined in a set of known and trusted task bundles. This package includes rules to confirm that the tasks that built the image were defined in task bundles, and that the task bundles used are from the list of known and trusted bundles.

| xref:packages/tasks_package.adoc[tasks]
a| Conforma expects that a set of tasks were included in the pipeline build for each image to be released. This package includes a set of rules to verify that the expected tasks ran in the pipeline when the image was built.

| xref:packages/test_package.adoc[test]
a| Conforma requires that each build was subjected to a set of tests and that those tests all passed. This package includes a set of rules to verify that.

| xref:packages/trusted_task_package.adoc[trusted_task]
a| This package is used to verify all the Tekton Tasks involved in building the image are trusted.

| xref:packages/rpm_ostree_task_package.adoc[rpm_ostree_task]
a| This package is responsible for verifying the rpm-ostree Tekton Task was executed with the expected parameters.
