= Policy Authoring

:numbered:

This document is meant to assist policy authors in creating and maintaining the policy rules
defined in this repository.

== Rule annotations

Policy rules must contain certain https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/annotations[annotations] that describe additional information about the
rule.

* `title`: (required) short description of the policy rule.
* `description`: (required) descriptive information about the policy rule, including possible
  remediation steps.
* `custom`: (required) object holding additional non-default rego annotations. `custom.foo` means
  the `foo` annotation nested under this object.
* `custom.short_name`: (required) unique name of the policy rule. This is used as the value of the
  `code` attribute when reporting failures and warnings. It is also the value used for skipping
  the policy rule via the https://github.com/enterprise-contract/enterprise-contract-controller[EnterpriseContractPolicy]. It must not contain spaces. Words must be
  joined by `_`, e.g. `snake_case`.
* `custom.failure_msg`: (required) message indicating the exact cause a policy rule did not pass.
  It should be as informative as possible to guide users towards remediation. The message can be
  in the form of a string template, allowing dynamic values to provide a more meaningful message.
* `custom.effective_on`: (optional) time stamp string in the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339[RFC3339] format. Defaults to
  `"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"`. A non-passing policy rule is classified as a warning, instead of a
  failure, if the date represented in the `custom.effective_on` annotation is in the future. This
  is a helpful mechanism to allow the introduction of a new policy rule while allowing a certain
  period of time for compliance.
* `custom.rule_data`: (optional) specify additional data for the policy rule. The value must be an
  object where each key maps to an array of strings. This is a convenient mechanism to specify
  information that is used in the policy rule evaluation that may not be obvious to users. For
  example, the policy rule `disallowed_task_step_image` only allows certain registries to be
  used. The list of registries is defined in the annotations
  `custom.rule_data.allowed_registry_prefixes`, allowing a single source of truth for policy rule
  evaluation and documentation. For best results, each key in the `custom.rule_data` object
  should be a noun.
* `custom.collections`: A list of strings representing a list of rule collections
  that the policy rule is included in.

The annotations must be defined at the `rule` https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/annotations/#scope[scope].

== Package annotations

Package annotations can be used to give a title and description to a package.
Use the package name "policy.<kind>.collection.<collectionName>" in an otherwise
empty package for collection annotations.

* `title`: (required) short description of the rule collection.
* `description`: (required) descriptive information about the rule collection.

See Open Policy Agent's
https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/annotations/[documentation] for
further reference on annotations.

== Input

The https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec-cli/main/index.html[ec-cli] is reponsible for gathering
the information to be validated which is made available to policies via the `input` object. Its
structure is defined https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec-cli/main/policy_input.html[here].
