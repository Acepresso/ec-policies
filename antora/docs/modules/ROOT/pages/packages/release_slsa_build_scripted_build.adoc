= SLSA - Build - Scripted Build Package

The SLSA requirement states the following:
"All build steps were fully defined in some sort of “build script”. The only manual command, if any, was to invoke the build script."
This package verifies the requirement by asserting the image was built by Tekton Pipelines.

== Package Name

* `slsa_build_scripted_build`

== Rules Included

[#slsa_build_scripted_build__build_script_used]
=== link:#slsa_build_scripted_build__build_script_used[Build task contains steps]

Verify that the predicate.buildConfig.tasks.steps attribute for the task responsible for building and pushing the image is not empty.

*Solution*: There were no build tasks detected. Make sure the build pipeline contains tasks and that the build system is recording them properly when the attestation is generated.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Build task %q does not contain any steps`
* Code: `slsa_build_scripted_build.build_script_used`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_build_scripted_build/slsa_build_scripted_build.rego#L21[Source, window="_blank"]

[#slsa_build_scripted_build__build_task_image_results_found]
=== link:#slsa_build_scripted_build__build_task_image_results_found[Build task set image digest and url task results]

Confirm that a build task exists and it has the expected IMAGE_DIGEST and IMAGE_URL task results.

*Solution*: Make sure the build pipeline contains a build task. The build task must contain results named 'IMAGE_DIGEST' and 'IMAGE_URL'.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Build task not found`
* Code: `slsa_build_scripted_build.build_task_image_results_found`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_build_scripted_build/slsa_build_scripted_build.rego#L48[Source, window="_blank"]

[#slsa_build_scripted_build__image_built_by_trusted_task]
=== link:#slsa_build_scripted_build__image_built_by_trusted_task[Image built by trusted Task]

Verify the digest of the image being validated is reported by a trusted Task in its IMAGE_DIGEST result.

*Solution*: Make sure the build Pipeline definition uses a trusted Task to build images.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Image %q not built by a trusted task: %s`
* Code: `slsa_build_scripted_build.image_built_by_trusted_task`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_build_scripted_build/slsa_build_scripted_build.rego#L106[Source, window="_blank"]

[#slsa_build_scripted_build__subject_build_task_matches]
=== link:#slsa_build_scripted_build__subject_build_task_matches[Provenance subject matches build task image result]

Verify the subject of the attestations matches the IMAGE_DIGEST and IMAGE_URL values from the build task.

*Solution*: Make sure the subject in the attestation matches the 'IMAGE_URL' and 'IMAGE_DIGEST' results from the build task. The format for the subject should be 'IMAGE_URL@IMAGE_DIGEST'.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The attestation subject, %q, does not match any of the images built`
* Code: `slsa_build_scripted_build.subject_build_task_matches`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_build_scripted_build/slsa_build_scripted_build.rego#L72[Source, window="_blank"]
