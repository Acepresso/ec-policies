This package is responsible for verifying the rpm-ostree Tekton Task was executed with the expected parameters.

== Package name

* `rpm_ostree_task`

== Rules included:

:numbered:

[#rpm_ostree_task__builder_image_param]
=== link:#rpm_ostree_task__builder_image_param[Builder image parameter]

Verify the BUILDER_IMAGE parameter of the rpm-ostree Task uses an image reference that is both pinned to a digest and starts with a pre-defined list of prefixes. By default, the list of prefixes is empty allowing any pinned image reference to be used. This is customizable via the `allowed_rpm_ostree_builder_image_prefixes` rule data.

*Solution*: Make sure the rpm-ostree Task uses a pinned image reference from a pre-approved location.
