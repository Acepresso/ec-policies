= SLSA - Source - Version Controlled Package

The SLSA requirement states the following:
"Every change to the source is tracked in a version control system that meets the following requirements:

  [Change history] There exists a record of the history of changes
  that went into the revision. Each change must contain: the
  identities of the uploader and reviewers (if any), timestamps of
  the reviews (if any) and submission, the change
  description/justification, the content of the change, and the
  parent revisions.

  [Immutable reference] There exists a way to indefinitely reference
  this particular, immutable revision. In git, this is the {repo URL +
  branch/tag/ref + commit ID}.

Most popular version control system meet this requirement, such as git, Mercurial, Subversion, or Perforce."
This package verifies the requirement by asserting the image was built from a git repository.

== Rules Included

[#slsa_source_version_controlled__materials_uri_is_git_repo]
=== link:#slsa_source_version_controlled__materials_uri_is_git_repo[Material uri is a git repo]

Ensure each entry in the predicate.materials array with a SHA-1 digest includes a valid Git URI.

*Solution*: Ensure the URI associated with a SHA-1 digest in the materials section of the attestation is valid. This URI is derived from the 'CHAINS-GIT_URL' output of the 'git-clone' task.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Material URI %q is not a git URI`
* Code: `slsa_source_version_controlled.materials_uri_is_git_repo`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_source_version_controlled/slsa_source_version_controlled.rego#L58[Source, window="_blank"]

[#slsa_source_version_controlled__materials_format_okay]
=== link:#slsa_source_version_controlled__materials_format_okay[Materials have uri and digest]

Confirm at least one entry in the predicate.materials array of the attestation contains the expected attributes: uri and digest.sha1.

*Solution*: Make sure the attestation contains the repository URI and digest.sha1. This information comes from the 'CHAINS-GIT_URL' and 'CHAINS-GIT_COMMIT' results in the 'git-clone' task.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `No materials match expected format`
* Code: `slsa_source_version_controlled.materials_format_okay`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_source_version_controlled/slsa_source_version_controlled.rego#L33[Source, window="_blank"]

[#slsa_source_version_controlled__materials_include_git_sha]
=== link:#slsa_source_version_controlled__materials_include_git_sha[Materials include git commit shas]

Ensure that each entry in the predicate.materials array with a SHA-1 digest includes a valid Git commit SHA.

*Solution*: Ensure the digest.sha1 in the materials section of the attestation is a valid Git commit SHA. This commit information is derived from the 'CHAINS-GIT_COMMIT' output of the 'git-clone' task.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Material digest %q is not a git commit sha`
* Code: `slsa_source_version_controlled.materials_include_git_sha`
