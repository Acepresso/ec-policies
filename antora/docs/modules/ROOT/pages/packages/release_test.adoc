= Test Package

Conforma requires that each build was subjected to a set of tests and that those tests all passed. This package includes a set of rules to verify that.

== Package Name

* `test`

== Rules Included

[#test__test_all_images]
=== link:#test__test_all_images[Image digest is present in IMAGES_PROCESSED result]

Ensure that task producing the IMAGES_PROCESSED result contains the digests of the built image.

*Solution*: Found an image not processed by a task. Make sure that the task processes and includes the image digest of all images in the `IMAGES_PROCESSED` result.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Test '%s' did not process image with digest '%s'.`
* Code: `test.test_all_images`
* Effective from: `2024-05-29T00:00:00Z`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L239[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__no_failed_informative_tests]
=== link:#test__no_failed_informative_tests[No informative tests failed]

Produce a warning if any informative tests have their result set to "FAILED". The result type is configurable by the "failed_tests_results" key, and the list of informative tests is configurable by the "informative_tests" key in the rule data.

*Solution*: There is a test that failed. Make sure that any task in the build pipeline with a result named 'TEST_OUTPUT' does not fail. More information about the test should be available in the logs for the build Pipeline.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator warning]#WARNING#
* WARNING message: `The Task %q from the build Pipeline reports a failed informative test`
* Code: `test.no_failed_informative_tests`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L17[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__no_erred_tests]
=== link:#test__no_erred_tests[No tests erred]

Produce a violation if any tests have their result set to "ERROR". The result type is configurable by the "erred_tests_results" key in the rule data.

*Solution*: There is a test that erred. Make sure that any task in the build pipeline with a result named 'TEST_OUTPUT' does not err. More information about the test should be available in the logs for the build Pipeline.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The Task %q from the build Pipeline reports a test erred`
* Code: `test.no_erred_tests`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L169[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__no_failed_tests]
=== link:#test__no_failed_tests[No tests failed]

Produce a violation if any non-informative tests have their result set to "FAILED". The result type is configurable by the "failed_tests_results" key, and the list of informative tests is configurable by the "informative_tests" key in the rule data.

*Solution*: There is a test that failed. Make sure that any task in the build pipeline with a result named 'TEST_OUTPUT' does not fail. More information about the test should be available in the logs for the build Pipeline.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The Task %q from the build Pipeline reports a failed test`
* Code: `test.no_failed_tests`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L144[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__no_test_warnings]
=== link:#test__no_test_warnings[No tests produced warnings]

Produce a warning if any tests have their result set to "WARNING". The result type is configurable by the "warned_tests_results" key in the rule data.

*Solution*: There is a task with result 'TEST_OUTPUT' that returned a result of 'WARNING'. You can find which test resulted in 'WARNING' by examining the 'result' key in the 'TEST_OUTPUT'. More information about the test should be available in the logs for the build Pipeline.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator warning]#WARNING#
* WARNING message: `The Task %q from the build Pipeline reports a test contains warnings`
* Code: `test.no_test_warnings`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L41[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__no_skipped_tests]
=== link:#test__no_skipped_tests[No tests were skipped]

Produce a violation if any tests have their result set to "SKIPPED". A skipped result means a pre-requirement for executing the test was not met, e.g. a license key for executing a scanner was not provided. The result type is configurable by the "skipped_tests_results" key in the rule data.

*Solution*: There is a test that was skipped. Make sure that each task with a result named 'TEST_OUTPUT' was not skipped. You can find which test was skipped by examining the 'result' key in the 'TEST_OUTPUT'. More information about the test should be available in the logs for the build Pipeline.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The Task %q from the build Pipeline reports a test was skipped`
* Code: `test.no_skipped_tests`
* Effective from: `2023-12-08T00:00:00Z`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L192[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__test_results_known]
=== link:#test__test_results_known[No unsupported test result values found]

Ensure all test data result values are in the set of known/supported result values.

*Solution*: The test results should be of a known value. Values can be set as a xref:cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data source].

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The Task %q from the build Pipeline has an unsupported test result %q`
* Code: `test.test_results_known`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L111[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__rule_data_provided]
=== link:#test__rule_data_provided[Rule data provided]

Confirm the expected rule data keys have been provided in the expected format. The keys are `supported_tests_results`, `failed_tests_results`, `informative_tests`, `erred_tests_results`, `skipped_tests_results`, and `warned_tests_results`.

*Solution*: If provided, ensure the rule data is in the expected format.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `%s`
* Code: `test.rule_data_provided`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L219[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__test_data_found]
=== link:#test__test_data_found[Test data found in task results]

Ensure that at least one of the tasks in the pipeline includes a TEST_OUTPUT task result, which is where Conforma expects to find test result data.

*Solution*: Confirm at least one task in the build pipeline contains a result named TEST_OUTPUT.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `No test data found`
* Code: `test.test_data_found`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L64[Source, window="_blank"]

[#test__test_results_found]
=== link:#test__test_results_found[Test data includes results key]

Each test result is expected to have a `results` key. Verify that the `results` key is present in all of the TEST_OUTPUT task results.

*Solution*: There was at least one result named TEST_OUTPUT found, but it did not contain a key named 'result'. For a TEST_OUTPUT result to be valid, this key must exist.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Found tests without results`
* Code: `test.test_results_found`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/test/test.rego#L88[Source, window="_blank"]
