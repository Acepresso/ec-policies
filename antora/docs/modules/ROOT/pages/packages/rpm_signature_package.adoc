= RPM Signature

This package provides rules for verifying the signatures of RPMs identified in the the SLSA Provenance attestation.

== Package name

* `rpm_signature`

== Rules included:

:numbered:

[#rpm_signature__allowed]
=== link:#rpm_signature__allowed[Allowed RPM signature key]

The SLSA Provenance attestation for the image is inspected to ensure RPMs have been signed by pre-defined set of signing keys. The list of signing keys can be set via the `allowed_rpm_signature_keys` rule data. Use the special value "unsigned" to allow unsigned RPMs.

*Solution*: Make sure to use RPMs that have been signed by the expected signing key. An RPM lacking such signature, usually indicated the RPM is not ready for consumption.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Signing key %q is not one of the allowed keys: %s`
