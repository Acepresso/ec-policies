= Tasks Package

Conforma expects that a set of tasks were included in the pipeline build for each image to be released. This package includes a set of rules to verify that the expected tasks ran in the pipeline when the image was built. Required tasks for a pipeline are specified in a data source provided at runtime. This data source features two primary rule data keys: pipeline-required-tasks and required-tasks. The pipeline-required-tasks key lists all required tasks broken down by pipeline name, while required-tasks details a default or baseline set of tasks. If your pipeline corresponds to an entry under pipeline-required-tasks, those tasks will be prioritized; otherwise, the system will default to the tasks listed under required-tasks. Required tasks are listed by the names given to them within the task definition. Optionally invocation parameter of a Task can be also mandated by including the name and the value in square brackets following the name of the task. For example: name[PARAM=val]. Only single parameter is supported, to assert multiple parameters repeat the required task definition for each parameter seperately.

== Package Name

* `tasks`

== Rules Included

[#tasks__required_untrusted_task_found]
=== link:#tasks__required_untrusted_task_found[All required tasks are from trusted tasks]

Ensure that the all required tasks are resolved from trusted tasks.

*Solution*: Make sure all required tasks in the build pipeline are resolved from trusted tasks.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator warning]#WARNING#
* WARNING message: `%s is required and present but not from a trusted task`
* Code: `tasks.required_untrusted_task_found`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L34[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__required_tasks_found]
=== link:#tasks__required_tasks_found[All required tasks were included in the pipeline]

Ensure that the set of required tasks are included in the PipelineRun attestation.

*Solution*: Make sure all required tasks are in the build pipeline. The required task list is contained as xref:cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data] under the key 'required-tasks'.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `%s is missing`
* Code: `tasks.required_tasks_found`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L171[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__data_provided]
=== link:#tasks__data_provided[Data provided]

Confirm the expected data keys have been provided in the expected format. The keys are `pipeline-required-tasks` and `required-tasks`.

*Solution*: If provided, ensure the data is in the expected format.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `%s`
* Code: `tasks.data_provided`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L285[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__future_required_tasks_found]
=== link:#tasks__future_required_tasks_found[Future required tasks were found]

Produce a warning when a task that will be required in the future was not included in the PipelineRun attestation.

*Solution*: There is a task that will be required at a future date that is missing from the build pipeline.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator warning]#WARNING#
* WARNING message: `%s is missing and will be required on %s`
* Code: `tasks.future_required_tasks_found`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L86[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__pinned_task_refs]
=== link:#tasks__pinned_task_refs[Pinned Task references]

Ensure that all Tasks in the SLSA Provenance attestation use an immuntable reference to the Task definition.

*Solution*: Make sure the build pipeline uses Tasks via pinned references. For example, if the git resolver is used, use a commit ID instead of a branch name.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Task %s is used by pipeline task %s via an unpinned reference.`
* Code: `tasks.pinned_task_refs`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L219[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__pipeline_has_tasks]
=== link:#tasks__pipeline_has_tasks[Pipeline run includes at least one task]

Ensure that at least one Task is present in the PipelineRun attestation.

*Solution*: Make sure the build pipeline ran any tasks and that the build system is generating a proper attestation.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `No tasks found in PipelineRun attestation`
* Code: `tasks.pipeline_has_tasks`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L116[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__pipeline_required_tasks_list_provided]
=== link:#tasks__pipeline_required_tasks_list_provided[Required tasks list for pipeline was provided]

Produce a warning if the required tasks list rule data was not provided.

*Solution*: The required task list is contained as xref:cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data] under the key 'required-tasks'. Make sure this list exists.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator warning]#WARNING#
* WARNING message: `Required tasks do not exist for pipeline`
* Code: `tasks.pipeline_required_tasks_list_provided`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L65[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__required_tasks_list_provided]
=== link:#tasks__required_tasks_list_provided[Required tasks list was provided]

Confirm the `required-tasks` rule data was provided, since it's required by the policy rules in this package.

*Solution*: Make sure the xref:cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data sources] contains a key 'required-tasks' that contains a list of tasks that are required to run in the build pipeline.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Missing required required-tasks data`
* Code: `tasks.required_tasks_list_provided`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L195[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__successful_pipeline_tasks]
=== link:#tasks__successful_pipeline_tasks[Successful pipeline tasks]

Ensure that all of the Tasks in the Pipeline completed successfully. Note that skipped Tasks are not taken into account and do not influence the outcome.

*Solution*: Make sure the build pipeline is properly configured so all the tasks can be executed successfully.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Pipeline task %q did not complete successfully, %q`
* Code: `tasks.successful_pipeline_tasks`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L141[Source, window="_blank"]

[#tasks__unsupported]
=== link:#tasks__unsupported[Task version unsupported]

The Tekton Task used is or will be unsupported. The Task is annotated with `build.appstudio.redhat.com/expires-on` annotation marking it as unsupported after a certain date.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Task %q is used by pipeline task %q is or will be unsupported as of %s. %s`
* Code: `tasks.unsupported`
* https://github.com/conforma/policy/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/tasks/tasks.rego#L246[Source, window="_blank"]
