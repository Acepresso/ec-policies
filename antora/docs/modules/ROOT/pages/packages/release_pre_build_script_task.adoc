= Pre-build-script task checks Package

This package verifies that the pre-build-script tasks in the attestation are executed in a controlled environment

== Package Name

* `pre_build_script_task`

== Rules Included

[#pre_build_script_task__pre_build_script_task_runner_image_allowed]
=== link:#pre_build_script_task__pre_build_script_task_runner_image_allowed[Script runner image comes from allowed registry]

Verify that the images used to run the pre-build script tasks come from a known set of trusted registries to reduce potential supply chain attacks. By default this policy defines trusted registries as registries that are fully maintained by Red Hat and only contain content produced by Red Hat. The list of allowed registries can be customized by setting the `allowed_registry_prefixes` list in the rule data.

*Solution*: Make sure the image referenced in the parameter 'SCRIPT_RUNNER_IMAGE' comes from a trusted registry. The list of trusted registries is a configurable xref:cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data source].

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Pre-Build-Script task runner image %q is from a disallowed registry`
* Code: `pre_build_script_task.pre_build_script_task_runner_image_allowed`

[#pre_build_script_task__valid_pre_build_script_task_runner_image_ref]
=== link:#pre_build_script_task__valid_pre_build_script_task_runner_image_ref[Script runner image is a valid image reference]

Verify that a valid image reference is specified as image being used to run the pre-build script task

*Solution*: Make sure the value in the 'SCRIPT_RUNNER_IMAGE_REFERENCE' result is a valid image reference

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Pre-Build-Script task runner image %q is not a valid image reference`
* Code: `pre_build_script_task.valid_pre_build_script_task_runner_image_ref`

=== link:#pre_build_script_task__pre_build_script_task_runner_image_in_sbom[Script runner image is included in the sbom]

Verify that the image used to run the pre-build script task is included in the SBOM

*Solution*: Make sure the image referenced in the 'SCRIPT_RUNNER_IMAGE_REFERENCE' result is included in the SBOM.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Pre-Build-Script task runner image %q is not in the SBOM`

=== link:#pre_build_script_task__pre_build_script_task_runner_image_in_results[Script runner image is listed in the task results]

Verify that the image used to run the pre-build script task is listed in the task result SCRIPT_RUNNER_IMAGE_REFERENCE

*Solution*: Make sure the image used to run the pre-build task is referenced in the 'SCRIPT_RUNNER_IMAGE_REFERENCE' task result.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `The runner image used for the pre-Build-Script task '%s' is not listed in the task results`
