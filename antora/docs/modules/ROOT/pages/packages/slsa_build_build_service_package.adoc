= SLSA - Build - Build Service

The SLSA requirement states the following:
"All build steps ran using some build service, not on a developerâ€™s workstation."
This package verifies the requirement by asserting the image was built by Tekton Pipelines.

== Package name

* `slsa_build_build_service`

== Rules included:

:numbered:

[#slsa_build_build_service__allowed_builder_ids_provided]
=== link:#slsa_build_build_service__allowed_builder_ids_provided[Allowed builder IDs provided]

Confirm the `allowed_builder_ids` rule data was provided, since it is required by the policy rules in this package.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `%s`
* Code: `slsa_build_build_service.allowed_builder_ids_provided`
* https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_build_build_service/slsa_build_build_service.rego#L69[Source, window="_blank"]

[#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_found]
=== link:#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_found[SLSA Builder ID found]

Verify that the attestation attribute predicate.builder.id is set.

*Solution*: The builder id in the attestation is missing. Make sure the build system is setting the build id when generating an attestation.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Builder ID not set in attestation`
* Code: `slsa_build_build_service.slsa_builder_id_found`
* https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_build_build_service/slsa_build_build_service.rego#L20[Source, window="_blank"]

[#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_accepted]
=== link:#slsa_build_build_service__slsa_builder_id_accepted[SLSA Builder ID is known and accepted]

Verify that the attestation attribute predicate.builder.id is set to one of the values in the `allowed_builder_ids` rule data, e.g. "https://tekton.dev/chains/v2".

*Solution*: Make sure the build id is set to an expected value. The expected values are set in the xref:ec-cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data sources].

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Builder ID %q is unexpected`
* Code: `slsa_build_build_service.slsa_builder_id_accepted`
* https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/release/slsa_build_build_service/slsa_build_build_service.rego#L42[Source, window="_blank"]
