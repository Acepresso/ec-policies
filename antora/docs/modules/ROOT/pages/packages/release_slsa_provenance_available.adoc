= SLSA - Provenance - Available Package

The SLSA Provenance Available requirement states the following:
"The provenance is available to the consumer in a format that the consumer accepts. The format SHOULD be in-toto SLSA Provenance, but another format MAY be used if both producer and consumer agree and it meets all the other requirements."
This package only accepts the in-toto SLSA Provenance format.

[#slsa_provenance_available__attestation_predicate_type_accepted]
=== link:#slsa_provenance_available__attestation_predicate_type_accepted[Expected attestation predicate type found]

Verify that the predicateType field of the attestation indicates the in-toto SLSA Provenance format was used to attest the PipelineRun.

*Solution*: The predicate type field in the attestation does not match the 'allowed_predicate_types' field. This field is set in the xref:cli:ROOT:configuration.adoc#_data_sources[data sources].
