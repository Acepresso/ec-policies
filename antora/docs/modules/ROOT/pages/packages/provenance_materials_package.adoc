:numbered:

Confirm that the result of the git-clone task is included in the materials section of the SLSA provenance attestation.

*Solution*: The build pipeline must contain a task named 'git-clone' and that task must emit results named 'url' and 'commit' and contain the clone git repository and commit, respectively.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
