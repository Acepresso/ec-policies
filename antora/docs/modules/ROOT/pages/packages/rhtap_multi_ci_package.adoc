= RHTAP Multi-CI

Checks for images built using an RHTAP build pipeline in either Jenkins, GitLab or GitHub. RHTAP pipelines are defined under https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-sample-templates/tree/main/skeleton/ci

== Package name

* `rhtap_multi_ci`

== Rules included:

:numbered:

[#rhtap_multi_ci__attestation_format]
=== link:#rhtap_multi_ci__attestation_format[SLSA Provenance Attestation Format]

Confirm the attestation created by the RHTAP Multi-CI build pipeline matches the expected format.

*Solution*: This check looks for some fields expected to be present in the SLSA attestation. Modifying the scripts that produce the attestation predicate might cause this to fail. See also the `att-predicate-*.sh` scripts at https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/tssc-dev-multi-ci/tree/main/rhtap

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `RHTAP %s attestation problem: %s`
* Code: `rhtap_multi_ci.attestation_format`

[#rhtap_multi_ci__attestation_found]
=== link:#rhtap_multi_ci__attestation_found[SLSA Provenance Attestation Found]

Verify an attestation created by the RHTAP Multi-CI build pipeline is present.

*Solution*: It appears the build pipeline did not create the expected SLSA provenance attestation. Check for relevant error messages in the 'cosign-sign-attest' pipeline step logs.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `A SLSA v1.0 provenance with one of the following RHTAP Multi-CI build types was not found: %s.`
