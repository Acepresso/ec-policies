= Acceptable Bundles

:numbered:

== Task Bundles

The Enterprise Contract requires that all Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline pipelines
use only tasks defined in these specific task bundles. See also the "Task bundle is not
acceptable" xref:release_policy#unacceptable_task_bundle[release] and
xref:pipeline_policy#unacceptable_task_bundle[policy] rules where this list is used.

The list of acceptable bundles is time based. A bundle that is acceptable today is not
necessarily acceptable tomorrow. The list below may contain bundles that are "too old"
and no longer acceptable. The reason for this behavior is to allow users a certain
period of time to upgrade to a newer bundle.

Any bundle with an effective date in the future, and the bundle with the most recent
effective date *not* in the future are acceptable. For example, consider a list that
includes the following acceptable bundles:

* a, effective on 2022-10-23
* b, effective on 2022-10-22
* c, effective on 2022-10-20
* d, effective on 2022-10-19

If today is 2022-10-21, then the bundles a, b, and c are acceptable, while d is not.

Even when using an acceptable bundle, some policy rules may emit a warning if the bundle
is not the latest one on the list. This is an attempt to notify users that although
there are no violations today, an update is required for continued compliance. In the
example above, using b or c would result in such a warning.
