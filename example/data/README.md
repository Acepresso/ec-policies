# Example Policy Data

This repository provides a set of files that include example policy data. These are meant to help
users that want to create their own policy data.

Currently, the data is split up into three different files. This is done purely to facilitate
maintenance of the data. They could, instead, be split across many other files, or even combined
into a single one. In any case, the data is merged into a single data source.
